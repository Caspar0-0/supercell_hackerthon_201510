## 🎤 How It Works

### 1. **Voice Recording**
- Browser captures audio using Web Audio API
- 5-second recording (can be stopped early)
- Audio stored as WebM format in browser

### 2. **Voice Analysis**
The Python backend analyzes:
- **Pitch** - Fundamental frequency (Hz)
- **Energy** - Volume/loudness (RMS)
- **Tempo** - Speaking rate (BPM)
- **Spectral Centroid** - Voice brightness

### 3. **Character Matching**
- Compares your voice to 45 character profiles
- Weighted algorithm:
  - 50% pitch similarity
  - 30% energy match
  - 20% tempo match
- Returns top 5 matches with detailed breakdowns

### 4. **Results Display**
- Voice analysis cards with your features
- Best match with character image and details
- Top 5 matches in a beautiful grid layout

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Good Audio Quality**
   - Use in a quiet environment
   - Speak clearly into your microphone
   - Hold microphone 6-12 inches from your mouth

2. **Try Different Styles**
   - Imitate character voice lines
   - Try different energy levels
   - Vary your pitch and tempo

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Works best in Chrome, Firefox, Safari (modern versions)
   - Requires HTTPS for microphone access (except localhost)
   - Enable microphone permissions when prompted

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Microphone Not Working
- **Check permissions**: Browser needs microphone access
- **HTTPS required**: Use localhost for development
- **Test microphone**: Try in browser settings first

### Analysis Errors
- **Speak louder**: Silent audio won't analyze
- **Minimum duration**: Record at least 2 seconds
- **Check console**: Look for error messages in browser DevTools

### Server Issues
- **Port in use**: Change port in `app.py` if 5000 is taken
- **Dependencies**: Make sure all requirements are installed
- **Python version**: Requires Python 3.8+

---

## 📊 Performance

- **Recording**: ~5 seconds
- **Upload**: < 1 second (local network)
- **Analysis**: 2-5 seconds (depends on CPU)
- **Total time**: ~10 seconds per analysis

---

## 🔒 Privacy

- ✅ All processing happens on your server
- ✅ No audio uploaded to external services
- ✅ No data stored after analysis
- ✅ Recordings deleted after browser refresh

---

## 🌐 Deployment to Render

This app is production-ready and can be deployed to Render with zero configuration!

### Quick Deploy Steps

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Add voice character matcher"
   git push origin voice-matching-web-interface-v1
   ```

2. **Deploy on Render**
   - Go to https://render.com and sign up/login with GitHub
   - Click "New +" → "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select branch: `voice-matching-web-interface-v1`
   - Render automatically detects `render.yaml` and configures:
     - ✅ Python environment
     - ✅ ffmpeg installation
     - ✅ Gunicorn production server
     - ✅ Environment variables
   - Click "Create Web Service"

3. **Done!** Your app will be live at `https://your-app-name.onrender.com` 🎉

### What's Included for Deployment

- **`Procfile`** - Tells Render to use Gunicorn production server
- **`render.yaml`** - Full configuration including ffmpeg dependency
- **`requirements.txt`** - All Python dependencies including gunicorn
- **Dynamic PORT binding** - App automatically uses Render's assigned port

### Free Tier Note

Render's free tier may "spin down" after inactivity, causing the first request to be slower (~30-60s). Upgrade to paid tier for always-on hosting.
